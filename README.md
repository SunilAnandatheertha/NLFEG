### Introduction
**NLFG** stands for Non-Linear Finite element codes for Graphene structures. Read the [MOTIVATION]() for developing NLFG, along with a set of [VALIDATION]() results, current [LIMITATIONS]() of PXO, [Tutorials and Test Cases]() which you can try out while learning to use. You may use the [DISCUSSION]() page to ask questions/clarifications, put forth your ideas, feature requests, documentation requests and bug reports. 

Development and all documentations by: [Sunil Anandatheertha](https://sunilanandatheertha.github.io/). Please start with [wiki page](https://github.com/SunilAnandatheertha/NLFEG/wiki). It will direct you. To use PXO, no installation is needed yet. Just add the folder to MATLAB path and start using. Sponsorer information will be listed here in the reverse chronological order. Please go through contributing.md to see how you may contribute. Contributer credits will be listed in detail here.
